# Project 2 - *NYTimes*

**NYTimes** is an android app that allows a user to search for articles on web using simple filters. The app utilizes [New York Times Search API](http://developer.nytimes.com/docs/read/article_search_api_v2).

Time spent: **25+** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] User can enter a search query that will display a grid of news articles using the thumbnail and headline from the New York Times Search API. (3 points)
* [x] User can click on "filter" icon which allows selection of advanced search options to filter articles. (3 points)
  * An example of a query with filters (begin_date, sort, and news_desk) applied can be found here. Full details of the API can be found on this article search README.
* [x] User can configure advanced search filters such as: (points included above)
  * [x] Begin Date (using a date picker)
  * [x] Sort order (oldest or newest) using a spinner dropdown
  * [x] News desk values (Arts, Fashion & Style, Sports) using checkboxes
* [x] Subsequent searches will have any filters applied to the search results. (1 point)
* [x] User can tap on any article in results to view the contents in an embedded browser. (2 points)
* [x] User can scroll down "infinitely" to continue loading more news articles. The maximum number of articles is limited by the API search. (1 point)

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Implements robust error handling, [check if internet is available](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Sending-and-Managing-Network-Requests#checking-for-network-connectivity), handle error cases, network failures
* [x] Used the **ActionBar SearchView** or custom layout as the query box instead of an EditText
* [x] User can **share an article link** to their friends or email it to themselves
* [x] Replaced Filter Settings Activity with a lightweight modal overlay
* [x] Improved the user interface and experiment with image assets and/or styling and coloring

The following **bonus** features are implemented:

* [x] Use the [RecyclerView](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-the-RecyclerView) with the `StaggeredGridLayoutManager` to display improve the grid of image results
* [x] For different news articles that only have text or only have images, use [Heterogenous Layouts](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Heterogenous-Layouts-inside-RecyclerView) with RecyclerView
* [x] Use Parcelable instead of Serializable using the popular [Parceler library](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-Parceler).
* [x] Leverages the [data binding support module](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Applying-Data-Binding-for-Views) to bind data into layout templates.
* [ ] Replace all icon drawables and other static image assets with [vector drawables](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Drawables#vector-drawables) where appropriate.
* [x] Replace Picasso with [Glide](http://inthecheesefactory.com/blog/get-to-know-glide-recommended-by-google/en) for more efficient image rendering.
* [x] Uses [retrolambda expressions](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Lambda-Expressions) to cleanup event handling blocks.
* [x] Leverages the popular [GSON library](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-Android-Async-Http-Client#decoding-with-gson-library) to streamline the parsing of JSON data.
* [x] Leverages the [Retrofit networking library](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Consuming-APIs-with-Retrofit) to access the New York Times API.
* [x] Replace the embedded `WebView` with [Chrome Custom Tabs](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Chrome-Custom-Tabs) using a custom action button for sharing. (_**2 points**_)

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [x] On re-selection of filters in the same session, transferring the user's previous filter selection from the articles search screen to the filter screen so that user does not have do it all over again!
* [x] Some basic readily available animation (referred to the links from the custom tabs guide) on the custom tabs.
